## Introduction
The project was commissioned by the organizer of the Easy-Code course. My task was to create a quiz using the assets sent to me. The quiz is based on React technology.

## Description
The quiz project includes five different categories in which we can test our knowledge. The questions are simple and each correct or incorrect answer is communicated to the user. At the end of the quiz, the points are counted and displayed on the page with the option of repeating the quiz or choosing a different category.
