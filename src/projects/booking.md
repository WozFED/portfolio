## Introduction

The project was commissioned by the organizer of the easy-code course. It was supposed to reflect the booking.com website as well as possible without specific instructions regarding the website functionality. As far as the functionality of the website is concerned, I was given a free hand. The main idea was to use gatsby technology, where I find it possible or more beneficial than using React itself. Due to the fact that the booking.com website is a website with a very extensive structure, I did not take into account all of them when I was designing it alone.

## Description
I included a few different functionalities in the project, and the main goal was to style the website like [www.booking.com] (https://www.booking.com/index.pl.html?aid=376384;label=Booking-PL-GokG1qZQBGAqiSCE_k2kpgS411092421248 pl: ta: p1: p22.563.000: ac: ap: neg: fi: tikwd-65526620: lp9067589: li: dec: dm: = ppccp UmFuZG9tSVYkc2RlIyh9Yf5EcukO1MOGv2VrE6ywbUM; = ws & gclid = CjwKCAiA78aNBhAlEiwA7B76pyrc9MHiAgfuq1cYg0IRqiW9hdiMKol4FddMnwh74mv0b6KeLxbBAhoCg88QAvD_BwE). The booking.com website could be slightly changed at the moment, as it is still a working website.

## Functions 
- You can translate the website into English / Polish (not all words have been translated)
- You can filter the hotels based on the (star) ratings
- Information about hotels is available on Contentful CMS
- Each hotel has its template with a detailed description
- Blog posts also have their own detailed descriptions (not all)
